 * the orientation sensor-fusion algorithm. Additionally,
 * an out-of-band signal is needed to pass the information from the
 * Producer (sensor) to the Consumer (SignalKOutput) whether the data
 * is valid or not. Using magic numbers can be done (e.g. a negative
 * value for temperature or heading) but needs customization for
 * particular parameters and data types. Rather than special values,
 * for Attitude we add a field to the struct that indicates
 * whether or not the numerical members are valid.
