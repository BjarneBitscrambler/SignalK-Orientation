/** @file main.cpp
 *  @brief Orientation output in Signal K format via SensESP.
 * This file provides examples for using the Orientation library together
 * with SensESP to report vessel orientation data to a Signal K server.
 * 
 * Intended hardware is an ESP32 or ESP8266 platform and an FXOS8700/FXAS21002
 * combination accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope.
 * 
 * The examples include:
 *   * Compass Heading output
 *   * Attitude (yaw, pitch, roll) output
 *   * Magnetic Heading (Compass reading corrected for deviations)
 *   * Physical switch to trigger saving of magnetic calibration
 *   * Tenperature output (taken from the sensor IC and corrected)
 *   * Acceleration in X,Y, Z axes
 *   * Turn, Pitch, and Roll Rates
 * Some example outputs are commented out by default: read the associated
 * comments for details.
